# Introduction to Statistical Learning

Repository with examples and my attempts at exercises from the 2nd edition of Tibshirani's Introduction to Statistical Learning. 

This was done as an educational exercise to develop a fundamental understanding of statistical learning methods. While most solutions are my work, I did refer to [Liam Morgan's excellent solutions on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/lmorgan95) for guidance.  

The exercises and examples from the Deep Learning Chapter have been implemented in Python directly, instead of using `reticulate` and other libraries to link R to Python.  

## Table of Contents 
I worked through the book in early 2022, and some files are missing. I have added the ones I did find.
